# Breakpoints

Here's the list of the default breakpoints:

```scss
$breakpoint-map: (
  "xs": 0,
  "sm": 768px,
  "md": 1024px,
  "lg": 1280px,
);
```

To edit the breakpoints, you can edit the sass map or copy it and import your custom breakpoints before the settings files of the framework. But keep the first breakpoint with a `0` value, in order for the mixins to work properly.

Remember: keeping the number of breakpoints as low as possible reduce complexity.
