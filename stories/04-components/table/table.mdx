# Table

Table component is meant to be used with just the class on the `<table>` element and the rest follow the standard html markup for tables. There are some variants to the standard view to extend the possibility of styling.

## Variants

|  Variant   |        Class        |                         Description                         |
| :--------: | :-----------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Bordered  |  `table-bordered`   |        Borders on all sides of the table and cells.         |
| Borderless | `table--borderless` |                For a table without borders.                 |
|  Striped   |  `table--striped`   | Add a zebra-striping to any table row within the `<tbody>`. |

## Responsive

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally. Make any table responsive across all viewports by wrapping a `table` with a `table-responsive` class.
