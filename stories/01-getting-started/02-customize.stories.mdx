# Customize

Extensible working base, the framework offers an architecture designed to be easily customizable.

The main elements that make up your design have default values that can be modified or overridden. This is the case for a variety of things like colors, text sizes, breakpoints, etc.

## Modify default values

In the `settings` folder is a set of maps categorized into files. The name of the property and the associated value have a direct impact on the available variables and utility classes. Modifying, adding or removing properties and / or values directly is an easy way to personalize your project.

### Use of css variables

The `elements / _root.scss` file contains all of the available css variables, the latter refer to the project settings.

## More to come

For now, very few components or objects are available. But there will be more comming. Meanwhile you can build your own with this base.

You alse can add your own settings or utilities if it suits your needs.
