# Introduction

This framework goal is to provide all the basics you will need to build an interface for your next project. To do so, it combine the best of both worlds with production ready components and useful utility classes and helpers.

## Almost utility first

If the framework provide a large variety of utility classes, the goal isn't to be utility based, but rather to use utilities to:

- **Build the layout to wrap the components** organize the content.
- **Customize a component** change many details for better extensibility.
- **Quickly build simple elements without the need to edit the CSS**.

## Customizable

Customization is a core value. With easily updatable project settings, you will be able to set your main aspect of yout project.
Same for utility classes, you can change their behaviour adding more with no pain.
