| :------------: | :----------------------: |
|    `hidden`    |     `display: none;`     |
|    `inline`    |    `display: inline;`    |
| `inline-block` | `display: inline-block;` |
|    `block`     |    `display: block;`     |
| `inline-flex`  | `display: inline-flex;`  |
|     `flex`     |     `display: flex;`     |
