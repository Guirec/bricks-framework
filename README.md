Bricks is a frontend framework to build awesome interfaces for your next e-commerce project. It is currently used at [Monsieur Biz](https://monsieurbiz.com/) to build our projects.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used to present the documentation and components. You can visualize it at [monsieurbiz.com/bricks-framework](https://monsieurbiz.com/bricks-framework/)

## Installation

Use the following commands to visualize locally:

```shell
npm install
npm run storybook
```

## How it works

Very basic right now, it will evolve continuously. The main philosophy of the framework is to offer a mixed approach between [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and a utility-first framework like [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). The goal is to offer a rich variety of full featured components and the efficiency of the utility classes.

### Styles

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is used to write the styles.

#### Architecture

- `settings`: Global variables, project-wide settings, etc.
- `tools`: Project-wide mixins, functions and placeholders.
- `elements`: Low-specificity, far-reaching rulesets and unclassed HTML elements.
- `objects`: Objects, abstractions, and design patterns.
- `components`: Complete chunks of UI.
- `utilities`: High-specificity, very explicit selectors.
