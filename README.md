Bricks is a frontend framework providing good complementarity between components and utility classes. It's currently used at [Monsieur Biz](https://monsieurbiz.com/) to build our projects.

## Build locally

Use the following commands to build locally:

```shell
npm install
npm run buildSass
```

You can also watch for changes with this command:

```shell
npm run watchSass
```

## How it works

Very basic right now, it will evolve continuously. The main philosophy of the framework is to offer a mixed approach between [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and a utility-first framework like [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). The goal is to offer a rich variety of full featured components and the efficiency of the utility classes.

### Styles

The styles in this framework take advantage of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

#### Architecture

- `settings`: Global variables, project-wide settings, etc.
- `tools`: Project-wide mixins, functions and placeholders.
- `elements`: Low-specificity, far-reaching rulesets and unclassed HTML elements.
- `objects`: Objects, abstractions, and design patterns.
- `components`: Complete chunks of UI.
- `utilities`: High-specificity, very explicit selectors.

## Contributing
